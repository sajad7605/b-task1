# Simple Snake Game Task

## Objective:
The goal of this task is to create a basic **Snake Game** using **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS (with Flexbox)**. This will help you practice handling keyboard events, updating the DOM, and basic CSS layout techniques.

### Features of the game:
- **Snake Movement**: The snake should be able to move in four directions (up, down, left, right) using arrow keys.
- **Game Over**: The game ends if the snake hits the boundaries of the game area.
- **Score**: Keep track of the player's score based on how long the snake survives.

## Requirements:
1. Create an HTML page to display the game.
2. Use **CSS Flexbox** to layout the game area and any other elements.
3. Implement the game logic using **vanilla JavaScript**.
4. Use **keyboard events** to control the snake's movement.
5. Display the player's score on the screen.

## Deliverables:
- A functioning snake game with the requirements above.
- Push your code to a new repository on GitHub.
- Add a simple **README.md** explaining how to run the game and what technologies you used.

### Deadline:
You have **6 days** to complete this task. Please ensure your repository is completed and submitted by the deadline.

Good luck, and happy coding!
